00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,436
Tanzania—home to some of the most breathtaking wildlife on Earth.

2
00:00:04,436 --> 00:00:13,308
Here, in the heart of East Africa, the great Serengeti National Park
hosts one of nature’s greatest spectacles: the Great Migration.

3
00:00:13,308 --> 00:00:22,417
Over a million wildebeest, zebras, and gazelles travel vast distances
in search of fresh grass, braving rivers filled with crocodiles.

4
00:00:22,417 --> 00:00:24,728
But predators are never far behind.

5
00:00:24,728 --> 00:00:29,813
Lions, the kings of the savanna, stalk their prey
with patience and precision.

6
00:00:29,813 --> 00:00:35,900
Cheetahs, the fastest land animals, chase down their targets in a
thrilling display of speed.

7
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,824
In the lush Tarangire National Park, giant elephants roam freely.

8
00:00:39,824 --> 00:00:45,360
These intelligent creatures form strong family bonds, protecting
their young from threats.

9
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:52,260
And in the ancient Ngorongoro Crater, the endangered black rhino
finds refuge, a rare sight in the wild.

10
00:00:52,260 --> 00:01:00,727
Tanzania’s wildlife is a treasure like no other—a delicate balance of
nature that reminds us of the beauty and power of the wild.
